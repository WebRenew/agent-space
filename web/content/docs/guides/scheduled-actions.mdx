# Scheduled Actions

Agent Space supports recurring task execution through the **Schedules** tab in Settings.

## What CRON Means in Agent Space

- `CRON` indicates a scheduled repeated task.
- `CRON` is not a file glob and should not label non-scheduled actions.

## Typical Use Cases

- Daily repo health checks
- Repeated summary generation
- Scheduled maintenance prompts
- Routine reporting workflows

## Configure A Schedule

1. Open **Settings -> Schedules**.
2. Click **+ Add Schedule**.
3. Set:
   - Task name
   - CRON expression (`minute hour day month weekday`)
   - Working directory
   - Prompt to run
4. Save the task.
5. Optionally click **Run now** to validate immediately.

## Useful CRON Examples

- `*/15 * * * *` every 15 minutes
- `0 * * * *` top of every hour
- `0 9 * * 1-5` weekday 9:00 AM
- `30 18 * * *` every day at 6:30 PM

## Validation Checklist

- Schedule status updates after each run.
- `Next run` and `Last run` timestamps update as expected.
- Errors are visible in the schedule card and diagnostics logs.

## Related Feature: Todo Runner

For large one-time or resumable checklists, use **Settings -> Todo Runner** instead of CRON.
Todo Runner executes todos sequentially until all are complete.
