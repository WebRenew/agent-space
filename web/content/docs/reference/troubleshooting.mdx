# Troubleshooting

## App opens in temp directory

Symptom: workspace resolves to a temp path like `/var/folders/.../agent-space-smoke-*`.

Fix:

1. Set default app workspace to your intended directory (for example `/Users/tradecraft/dev`).
2. Reopen workspace from Explorer and verify path in scope indicator.

## Blue screen / renderer crash

1. Restart app.
2. Reopen one workspace first.
3. Check local logs for renderer/main process errors.
4. If reproducible, capture steps and last action before crash.

## Search missing expected files

1. Confirm workspace root is correct.
2. Verify excluded directories are not your target paths.
3. Grant missing file permissions in macOS privacy settings.

## Duplicate active agents

If one chat appears as multiple office agents, refresh session state or restart app and verify single active thread.

## Todo Runner job not progressing

1. Confirm **Runner command** is valid and executable in the selected working directory.
2. Run the same command manually in terminal to verify dependencies are installed.
3. Check that your runner reads todo context from env/stdin and exits with non-zero on failures.
4. Inspect the latest error shown in the Todo Runner card and fix the underlying worker issue.
